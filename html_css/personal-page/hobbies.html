    <h2>Cycling</h2>
    <p>One of my favourite activities is cycling. I like to explore new places and bike is really useful for that
        purpose. Cycling in Jyväskylä is even more enjoyable and delightful with all it's hills and beautiful nature!

    <h2>Programming</h2>
    <p>Programming as well as computer repairing is in the list of my main hobbies. I started getting interested in
        computers when I was a child. I truly enjoy upgrading old computers and repairing them. In addition to that, I'm
        extremely excited about programming - I like to solve some coding exercises as well as making my own simple
        apps.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Cars</h2>
    <p>I am really passionate about cars as well as about autosport. I love reading about cars, watching reviews and
        driving. The auto racing category I like the most is rally. I know that rally is really popular in Finland, so I
        hope to visit some car event in future.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Cooking</h2>
    <p>I like cooking and enjoy watching cooking shows. Cooking attracts me because it never gets repetetive and I can
        be creative during the cooking process :)</p>
