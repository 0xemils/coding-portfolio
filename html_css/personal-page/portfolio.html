    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <p>My name is Emils. Before entering JAMK I was living in Latvia. One of my hobbies is programming, that's the
        reason why I really want to study the ICT program. I am always eager to learn new skills. Also, I
        have experience working on a project as part of a team and individually.</p>
