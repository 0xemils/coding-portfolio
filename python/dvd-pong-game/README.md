# DVD Pong Game

## How to play:

When the game launches, the DVD logo will appear on the screen.
The logo works as a ball.
Using the left and right paddle it is possible to beat off
the logo to the opposite side of the field. Paddles are controlled by pressing
Up and Down arrows (right side) and W and S (left side).

When one player misses the "ball", one score point is added to his
opponent.

The game is meant for 2 players.
