# Flash Card App
## App for studying flashcards.

#
The program's purpose is to help in learning words or terms, as 
the content is fully customizable.

The app uses a CSV file to store information needed for learning.
In this case, it is French words with English translations.

It is possible to modify the file and add your own content to learn.

### How the app works:

After the program is launched, a learning card will appear
on the screen. After 3 seconds card will "flip" to the opposite
side.

Under the card, there are 2 buttons, so it is possible to
mark the card as known by pressing the green button, and
that card will not appear until all the cards will
be marked as known.

After all the cards were marked as known, all the cards
will restore (a warning will appear).
